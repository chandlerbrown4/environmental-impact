## Step 1: Acquire Dual-View Sentinel-1 Data

### 1.1 Define Area of Interest (AOI)

**Objective**: Clearly delineate the geographic boundaries of the section of land for which the DEM will be generated.

**Steps**:

1. **Create or Obtain AOI Shapefile**:
    - Use GIS software (e.g., QGIS, ArcGIS) to draw the AOI polygon or obtain an existing shapefile.
    - Ensure the AOI covers the area where DEM generation is required.

2. **Set Coordinate Reference System (CRS)**:
    - Common CRS for Sentinel data: **WGS 84 / UTM** (appropriate zone for your AOI).
    - Verify that the AOI shapefile uses the correct CRS to match Sentinel data.

**Tips**:

- Use the highest possible resolution for the AOI to capture detailed topographical features.
- Save the AOI shapefile in a dedicated directory for easy access during data acquisition.

### 1.2 Search and Select Sentinel-1 Scenes

**Objective**: Identify Sentinel-1 SAR scenes that enable interferometric analysis by ensuring similar acquisition dates and different orbital positions.

**Criteria for Dual-View Data**:

- **Acquisition Dates**: Select scenes captured within a short temporal window (e.g., same month) to minimize temporal decorrelation.
- **Orbital Passes**: Choose scenes from ascending and descending orbits to provide dual views necessary for interferometry.
- **Coverage**: Ensure that both scenes fully cover the AOI without gaps.

**Steps**:

1. **Log In to Copernicus Open Access Hub**:
    - Navigate to [Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/).
    - Log in with your registered account credentials.

2. **Define Search Parameters**:
    - **Area**: Upload or draw the AOI shapefile.
    - **Time Range**: Set a narrow temporal range (e.g., within the same month/year).
    - **Sensor**: Select **Sentinel-1**.
    - **Product Type**: Typically **GRD (Ground Range Detected)** or **SLC (Single Look Complex)** for interferometry.
    - **Polarization**: Preferably **VV+VH** for better interferometric results.

3. **Apply Filters**:
    - **Relative Orbit Number**: Select scenes with different relative orbit numbers (e.g., odd and even) to ensure different orbital paths.
    - **Number of Look Directions**: Ensure dual-view coverage.

4. **Review Search Results**:
    - Examine metadata to confirm dual-view suitability.
    - Check for cloud cover and data quality indicators (not applicable for SAR, but ensure data integrity).

5. **Select Appropriate Scenes**:
    - Choose pairs of scenes that meet dual-view criteria and cover the AOI comprehensively.

**Tips**:

- **Interferometric Baseline**: Aim for a moderate baseline (e.g., 100-300 meters) to balance coherence and DEM accuracy.
- **Seasonal Considerations**: Select scenes from periods with minimal vegetation changes to enhance phase coherence.

### 1.3 Download Sentinel-1 Data

**Objective**: Obtain the selected Sentinel-1 SAR scenes in `SAFE` format for further processing.

**Steps**:

1. **Select Scenes for Download**:
    - From the search results, select the Sentinel-1 scenes identified in [Step 1.2](#12-search-and-select-sentinel-1-scenes).

2. **Initiate Download**:

    - Choose the download format as `SAFE` (Standard Archive Format for Europe).

3. **Verify Download Completeness**:
    - Ensure that all files are fully downloaded without interruptions.
    - Use checksum verification tools if available to confirm data integrity.

4. **Organize Downloaded Data**:
    - Create a dedicated directory structure (e.g., `Sentinel1_Data/AOI_Name/`) to store the downloaded `SAFE` files.
    - Extract the `.zip` files if necessary, maintaining the `SAFE` folder structure.

**Tips**:

- **Automation**: Utilize Python scripts with the `sentinelsat` library to automate the search and download process.
